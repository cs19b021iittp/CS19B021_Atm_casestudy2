  This folder consists of 3 java class files.
          Account class   consists of name,account number,pin and amount in the  account, ifsc code and methods such as re-enter pin,generate otp, verify pin,change pin,view    balance,withdraw,deposit,change details.

In the Atm class I used hashmap to store the data of 5 accounts as index, account and then I executed all the process.

1.    firstly user is asked to enter the account number. If its not matching with any of the 5 account numbers then it prints invalid account number.
2.    If the account number entered is correct then user will be asked to enter the pin.If the entered pin doesnâ€™t match with the pin of respective account,it will be shown as   i       invalid or incorrect pin.
3.    If the entered pin is correct, user will be asked to choose one among 5 options i.e,deposit,withdraw,view balance,transfer to other account ,change details.
4.    After selection, 6 digit otp is displayed.user has to enter the otp.If the entered otp is correct then the respective operations are performed.

       In the main class,I just created a constructor and called the method
       Start atm.
